The odin project recipes task 

In this file, I was asked to reflect on the skills that I have currently for web-development and as a coder in general, and I figure that I have a very basic understanding of code, of html and css and javascript

I hope to get better exponentially so that I can make projects that will make me good money and be of value to people, so that I can set up digital businesses that I can run from anywhere in the world to sustain my family and myself

Ill come back and look at this, I also have to remmeber to make this readme file private lol. almost new year 2022.
